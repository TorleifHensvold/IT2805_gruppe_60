			<h3> Responsibilities </h3>
			<p> Lukas and Tofleif was mostly responsible for generating the navbar in addNavBar.js. This mostly went as
				planned as described in the P2 document, the only major difference is that we didn’t go for a logo. </p>
			<p> Lukas was responsible for most related to the menu, that includes menu.html, menu.js and focusWindow.js.
				In the menu.js you have a function that can add menuItems to the cart, so the minimum requirements set
				to this from P2 were met. </p>
			<p> Torleif was responsible for everything related to the cart, this includes cart.html, cart.js and
				cartTestingScript.js, and he also contributed the menuItems.js. This included handling of the menuItems
				in the cart of course, so it met the minimum requirements we sat for it. </p>
			<p> Niklas was responsible for everything related to contact_us.html and about_us.html sites, this includes
				contact.js and opening_hours.js. On the site you could write a message to us, and get a response
				generated by javascript, and there were also an email link. This met the minimum requirements that was
				meant from when we planned in P2, even though we forgot to write it down there. </p>
			<p> Saleh was responsible for the start page index.html. </p>
			<p> Everyone was responsible for doing the styling in general and for the specific site they were
				responsible for. </p>
			<p> Torleif was responsible for taking the text from our google docs and making html for it and uploading
				the files to his folk.ntnu. </p>
			<p> In general everyone also completed their responsibilities in the timeframe we sat ourselves. </p>

			<h3> Changes </h3>
			<h4> Menu Changes </h4>
			<p> Changed image resolution ratio from 4:3 to 16:9 on the dish images, but the small images will be
				displayed with 4:3, but scales them correctly so that not all of the images comes with, using cover
				property (I think this looks better). The smaller images will essentially be more zoomed in, but without
				stretching, so it looks good. The large image will still be displayed at raw 16:9 ratio. Large
				resolution will be 800x450 px, and the small ones 240x180 px. </p>
			<p> It was mentioned that buttons should have some animations in P2, but not specifically what. Buttons have
				now gotten animations when hovering over. They become white and have some basic shadow when hovering
				over. This goes for all buttons in the whole project. </p>
			<p> In the dish window, when selecting a menu item, have been changed slightly from the p2 design. It will
				not have a back button or cross button, because you can easily just click on the greyed out underlay to
				do that there. We will find out if this is not clear enough for our audience when testing. </p>
			<p> The response message when adding something in cart is a new window that has two buttons: “back to menu”
				and “go to cart”. In addition there is some simple text that says what you added. This was mentioned in
				the P2 design document, but not specifically how it would be. </p>
			<br>

			<h4> Menu.js script changes </h4>
			<p> Added a function that generate all the menu items (generateMenuItems) based on the info that is in the
				menuItems array, that has objects with each dishes information. The const menuItems array will also now
				be in its own js file, menuItems.js, so that the cart and other sites can use it without using the whole
				menu.js file. This is so that everything will be as modular and independent as possible. </p>
			<p> Also added a createWindowDiv-function that will make a div with the content of what will be in a window
				when you click on a menu Item. This function takes in an object that has all the information about the
				menu-Item, this is taken from the menuItems array. This function is used in generateMenuItems. </p>
			<br>

			<h4> focusWindow.js script changes </h4>
			<p> Removed the ability to specify width and height for the window. This is because it is easier to make the
				window responsive. </p>
			<p> Added a function that unfocuses the window that is currently focused. </p>
			<br>

			<h4>Cart changes</h4>
			<p>
				The additional page/popup for adding the payment solution was removed from the scope of the cart page,
				mostly because the amount of javascript needed to build the page in itself was fairly extensive. Another
				reason for the removal of the popup for payment solution was the fact that if it would be used as a
				website for a real restaurant then the payment solution would without a doubt be external in some way,
				as that is way more secure than trying to make it yourself.
			</p>
			<p>
				The look of each of the items did get a slight change with the background becoming a slight green, the
				buttons for adding and subtracting from the number of each dish ending up closer to the picture of the
				food item, and the price ended up below the image of the food item. This is simply because a lot of
				different ways to try to achieve the look of the mock-up failed to do so. After many hours of working
				with this the fact that it still looks close to the mock-up was deemed within spec.
			</p>

			<h4> "Contact us"-changes </h4>
			<p> In addition to the content shown in the mock-up, there has been added a yellow banner confirming your
				inquiry (after you’ve successfully sent an inquiry through the on-site form). </p>
