			<h3> Responsibilities </h3>
			<p> Lukas and Tofleif was mostly responsible for generating the navbar in addNavBar.js. This mostly went as planned as described in the p2 document, the only major difference is that we didn’t go for a logo. </p>
			<p> Lukas was responsible for most related to the menu, that includes menu.html, menu.js and focusWindow.js. In the menu.js you have a function that can add menuItems to the cart, so the minimum requirements set to this from p2 were met. </p>
			<p> Torleif was responsible for everything related to the cart, this includes cart.html, cart.js and cartTestingScript.js, and he also contributed the menuItems.js. This included handling of the menuItems in the cart of course, so it met the minimum requirements we sat for it. </p>
			<p> Niklas was responsible for everything related to contact_us.html and about_us.html sites, this includes contact.js and opening_hours.js. On the site you could write a message to us, and get a response generated by javascript, and there were also an email link. This met the minimum requirements that was meant from when we planned in p2, even though we forgot to write it down there. </p>
			<p> Saleh was responsible for the start page index.html. </p>
			<p> Everyone was responsible for doing the styling in general and for the specific site they were responsible for. </p>
			<p> Torleif was responsible for taking the text from our google docs and making html for it and uploading the files to his folk.ntnu. </p>
			<p> In general everyone also completed their responsibilities in the timeframe we sat ourselves. </p>

			<h3> Changes </h3>
			<h4> Menu Changes </h4>
			<p> Changed image resolution ratio from 4:3 to 16:9 on the dish images, but the small images will be displayed with 4:3, but scales them correctly so that not all of the images comes with, using cover property (I think this looks better). The smaller images will essentially be more zoomed in, but without stretching, so it looks good. The large image will still be displayed at raw 16:9 ratio. Large resolution will be 800x450 px, and the small ones 240x180 px. </p>
			<p> It was mentioned that buttons should have some animations in p2, but not specifically what. Buttons have now gotten animations when hovering over. They become white and have some basic shadow when hovering over. This goes for all buttons in the whole project. </p>
			<p> In the dish window, when selecting a menu item, have been changed slightly from the p2 design. It will not have a back button or cross button, because you can easily just click on the greyed out underlay to do that there. We will find out if this is not clear enough for our audience when testing. </p>
			<p> The response message when adding something in cart is a new window that has two buttons: “back to menu” and “go to cart”. In addition there is some simple text that says what you added. This was mentioned in the p2 design document, but not specifically how it would be. </p>
			<br>

			<h4> Menu.js script changes </h4>
			<p> Added a function that generate all the menu items (generateMenuItems) based on the info that is in the menuItems array, that has objects with each dishes information. The const menuItems array will also now be in its own js file, menuItems.js, so that the cart and other sites can use it without using the whole menu.js file. This is so that everything will be as modular and independent as possible. </p>
			<p> Also added a createWindowDiv-function that will make a div with the content of what will be in a window when you click on a menu Item. This function takes in an object that has all the information about the menu-Item, this is taken from the menuItems array. This function is used in generateMenuItems. </p>
			<br>

			<h4> focusWindow.js script changes </h4>
			<p> Removed the ability to specify width and height for the window. This is because it is easier to make the window responsive. </p>
			<p> Added a function that unfocuses the window that is currently focused.  </p>
			<br>

			<h4> "Contact us"-changes </h4>
			<p> In addition to the content shown in the mock-up, there has been added a yellow banner confirming your inquiry (after you’ve successfully sent an inquiry through the on-site form). </p> 
			<br>

			<h4> Cart Changes </h4>
