<h4>
	Administrative details
</h4>
<p>
	Client contact: Gradon Ramsey, owner of Hall’s Kitchen
</p>

<h4>
	Purpose and goals
</h4>
<p>
	The purpose of the site is to allow customers to see a menu and know where to go to visit
	the restaurant, as well as being able to order online for either pickup or eat-in meal.
</p>

<h4>
	Audience
</h4>
<p>
	The intended audience of the site are families.
	The website needs to be user friendly for the whole family, so both young and old.
	So the interface needs to be fairly simple. For example big enough font for everyone.
</p>

<p>
	The site needs to be responsive to different formats, primarily computer and mobile viewing.
</p>


<h4>
	The content of the site and how it is organized
</h4>
<p>
	The following list shows what pages and subpages the site will have, as per this moment
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Main page
		<ul style="list-style: none">
			<li>
				This is where you get general information and overview of the site.
				The main page should also be kind of catchy, possibly with a picture of
				Gradon Ramsey, so that the customers can get a good feel for the site.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Menu
		<ul style="list-style: none">
			<li>
				In this page you can see the overview of the menu and all the practical
				information of the dishes (price, size, etc.)
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		All the different dishes
		<ul style="list-style: none">
			<li>
				This is where you can see all the different dishes more in detail, with
				in-depth information about each individual dish. Here it could possibly
				be a image gallery (slideshow), or some other interface where you can choose the dish to view.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Reservation and order
		<ul style="list-style: none">
			<li>
				This is a page where you can either register a table reservation or make
				an order for delivery. There should be an interface for choosing between
				the two. And there needs to be the actual interfaces for reserving and
				ordering. Here it could for example be dropdown-menus with the dishes
				and other things that makes it simple and practical for the user.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Contact us
		<ul style="list-style: none">
			<li>
