			<h2> Testing Document </h2>
			<p> We asked our testers to use our website for a little while (ca. 5-10 minutes). Then
				asked them fill out our questionnaire. This includes basic information about the user
				(age, gender, experience), as well as questions about the design, functionality,
				usability and navigation. We asked the users to rate certain features/qualities
				regarding the different categories, and if they had any additional comments or
				concerns. We made this into a google form and sent it to the tester, as well as
				observing some of them.

				link </a> to the google form
			</p>
			<p>
				(Note: The form is in norwegian as we saw it more appropriate for the tester audience as they were all
				norwegian).

			<h2> Tester Audience </h2>
			<p> We tried to get a variety of testers, from both young and old, and people with and without programming
				experience. However, it was challenging to get enough tests, especially in the older ranges. Though, we
				feel that we got enough tests to get a sense of how the web site stood up and to address some core
				issues. </p>
			<p> The following diagrams shows the composition of the tester audience. </p>

			<h2> Testing Platforms </h2>
			<img src="images/enhet.PNG" alt="Diagram av enheter">
			<p> We got some to test on mobile, something that was useful as most of our comments were directed towards
				issues on mobile.
				We assumed that everyone was using a standard updated browser like google chrome, firefox or safari as
				this is the norm.

			<h2> Feedback Summary </h2>
			<h3> Design </h3>
			<img src="images/design.PNG" alt="Diagram av enehter">
			<p> There wasn't any concrete criticism or comment because it can be hard to articulate design as it can be
				subjective. Therefore, it can be hard to know anything specific to change. However, we are also happy
				enough with the result. </p>
			<br>

			<h3> Content </h3>
			<img src="images/innhold.PNG" alt="Diagram av innhold">
			<p> Some commented that there could be information about delivery. We decided that it should be included at
				the payment-step in the process of ordering, and as this is outside the scope of the project, we made
				the decision not to include it. </p>
			<p> Another comment was they felt it lacked more specific details for dishes, for example calories etc. This
				is something we could add if it this was a more professional project, but felt it wasn't necessary in
				this project. </p>
			<br>

			<h3> Navigation </h3>
			<img src="images/navigasjon.PNG" alt="Diagram av navigasjon">
			<p> Here we are very satisfied with the grading. Some commented that the buttons on mobile could possibly be
				too small. “Buttons for clicking image in menu is too small, and maybe should have been whole image”.
				This is something we have thought about, but we feel that it is more clear for the user if it says
				“More” with a button, especially users that are not used to have images work as something you can click
				on (older people for instance). </p>
			<br>

			<h3> Useability </h3>

			<br>

			<h3> Functionality </h3>
			<img src="images/funksjonalitet.PNG" alt="Diagram av funksjonalitet">
			<p> These (including usability) got one hundred percent satisfaction, as well as no comments. Therefore, we
				have concluded that our design was intuitive to use and that the functionality was complete for our
				purposes. </p>

			<h3> Our Response </h3>
			<p> The feedback we got indicated that the only issues users had with the site was in regards to the mobile
				version. What we learned is that if we were to further develop this site, we would work on optimizing
				the experience on mobile devices.
			</p>
			<p> Other than that we feel that most of the core functional and non-functional requirements
				that we specified from earlier was largely confirmed through the tests.
				This includes that a user should be able to order food, viewing menu items as photos, find location of
				the restaurant and that the site in general should be easy to use and navigate for the user. This is
				especially confirmed by how good the grading were for usability, navigation and functionality.

			<h3> Self-Reflection </h3>
			<p> Overall, we think that the project went well, but of course there were some things that we think could
				be done differently. In this short reflection we are going to go over what we learnt, both things that
				we felt we did well and also things that might have done differently next time.
			</p>
			<p> A thing that we felt that went well was meeting and planning the project in general. We mostly met 1
				time each week, and assigned the work to each team member so that we could work on our own, and then
				come together and update each member of what we did. We also had a time schedule on when things should
				be done. This was a useful way to work because we could spend most time doing the actual work, but at
				the same time be on the same page. If there were something specific we were unsure about, we just asked
				in our chat and resolved it quickly.
			</p>
			<p> Using git have also been really useful, but at the same time it has made it more difficult for some in
				the group because they had to spend time learning it for the first time. However, the more time we spent
				using it the better it got, and the more we realized how useful git was. For example if people are
				working on different things in parallel it makes things easier to merge together the work.
			</p>
			<p> A possible mistake we did was maybe that we tried to think too much outside of the box to make something
				that was in the gray area of being outside the scope of the course. More specifically, trying to use
				persistence (JSON files) in our site to have menu selection and make it remember it in the cart. We were
				able to pull it off with a compromise (using localStorage), with being inside the scope of the course,
				and we think it went really well in the end, but it might have been risky. If we found out that we
				wouldn't be able to do it, then we could have wasted a lot of time and energy, and the final result of
				the project would have possibly become worse. In the future, this is something that we have to think of
				early on and make the appropriate compromises if possible. However, in the end we felt we made a good
				compromise and it worked out well.
			</p>
			<p> In the end, we feel that we have learned a lot from the project, especially about how to do programming
				group projects in general. This includes using git, meeting, making schedules, and how to make
				compromises. This is something that we will take with us in future programming projects. </p>
