			<h1>Welcome to Hall's Kitchen</h1>

			<p>
				Restaurants originated a long time ago on the main roads to serve the passengers and provide food and shelter for money and then developed and spread in all streets and areas. Today, a restaurant has become a place for family entertainment, picnicking and meeting friends, as well as delicious food and drinks.
